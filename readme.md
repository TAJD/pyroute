# Python routing

> Sailing craft route modelling modelled in Python.

This collection of scripts allow the modelling of sailing craft routing in Python. It provides the ability to model;

1. Reliability
2. Discretisation error

Research continued in [sail_route](https://github.com/TAJD/sail_route.jl)

# Installation

Git clone the repository. I hope to add the package version list to allow quick installation.
