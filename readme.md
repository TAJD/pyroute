# Python routing

> Sailing craft route modelling modelled in Python.

This collection of scripts allow the modelling of sailing craft routing in Python. It provides the ability to model;

2. Discretisation error

# Installation

I have not worked up a formal installation process yet as I have switched my focus towards continuing my work in Julia, as seen in [sail_route](https://github.com/TAJD/sail_route.jl)
